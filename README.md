# V Rising Dedicated Server Instructions
The V Rising Dedicated Server is the server application for the game V Rising ([Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1604030/V_Rising/), [Playstation 5](https://store.playstation.com/concept/10007965)).

There is a server packaged with the client, which runs in the background when you start a local private game from within the game client, but these instructions are for when you want to download and run your own dedicated server.
